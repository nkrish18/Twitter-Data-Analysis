# Twitter Data Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze tweets from the top three news channels on twitter namely BBC, CNN, and ABC. Lately most channels have been publishing a lot of negative content and I didn't want my twitter feed to drag my mood down. I wanted to find the perfect channel to get my news from that would liven up my mood.
